# üõ†Ô∏è Fix for Infinite Server Action Errors

## Problem
The application was experiencing infinite errors related to "use server" directives, specifically:
```
Error: A "use server" file can only export async functions, found object.
```

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by importing Node.js filesystem utilities (`fs/promises` and `path`) at the top level of a server action file (`lib/actions/settings.ts`). When using "use server" directive, all imports must be compatible with the server actions environment.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Removed Problematic Import
```typescript
// REMOVED: This was causing the error
import { deleteAvatarFile } from '../utils/avatar-cleanup';
```

### 2. Used Dynamic Imports
Replaced the static import with dynamic imports inside the functions where file operations are needed:

```typescript
// NEW: Dynamic imports inside async functions
try {
  const { unlink } = await import('fs/promises');
  const { join } = await import('path');
  const filename = avatarUrl.split('/').pop();
  if (filename) {
    const filePath = join(process.cwd(), 'public', 'uploads', 'avatars', filename);
    await unlink(filePath);
  }
} catch (error) {
  console.warn('Failed to delete avatar file:', error);
}
```

### 3. Benefits of This Approach
- ‚úÖ Maintains server action compatibility
- ‚úÖ Keeps file cleanup functionality intact
- ‚úÖ Provides proper error handling
- ‚úÖ Uses dynamic imports only when needed
- ‚úÖ No performance impact since imports are cached

## Files Modified
- `/home/hassaan/toptech/Kudu/lib/actions/settings.ts` - Fixed server action imports

## Result
- ‚úÖ Server starts without infinite errors
- ‚úÖ Avatar upload functionality preserved
- ‚úÖ File cleanup still works correctly
- ‚úÖ All server actions are now compliant

## Server Status
- üöÄ Running on: http://localhost:3001
- ‚úÖ No compilation errors
- ‚úÖ Settings page accessible
- ‚úÖ Avatar upload system functional

The infinite error issue has been resolved and the avatar upload system is now working correctly!
