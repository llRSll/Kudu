# Property Management Module Implementation

This document outlines the implementation of the Property Management module in the Kudu application, with a focus on the property detail page.

## Architecture Overview

The implementation follows a server-client architecture with:
- Server-side data fetching using React Server Components
- Client-side interactivity via Client Components
- Supabase for database and file storage
- Server Actions for data mutations

## Key Components

1. **Server Components:**
   - Property detail page (`app/(protected)/properties/[id]/page.tsx`)
   - Data fetching using server actions
   - Parallel data loading with Promise.all

2. **Client Components:**
   - Property detail client wrapper (`components/properties/property-detail-client.tsx`)
   - Property overview tab (`components/properties/property-overview.tsx`)
   - Property images carousel with upload/delete functionality
   - Editable property details form
   - Financial summary component
   - Tenant and maintenance summaries

3. **Server Actions:**
   - Property CRUD operations (`app/actions/properties.ts`)
   - Financial summaries management
   - Tenant management
   - Maintenance items management
   - Property images handling
   - Cash flow management (`app/actions/cashflows.ts`)

4. **Database Schema:**
   - Tables for properties, financial summaries, tenants, maintenance items, property images, and cash flows
   - Relationships and constraints outlined in `drizzle/property_management_tables.sql`

## Key Features

1. **Property Images:**
   - Multiple image support with a carousel
   - Image upload to Supabase Storage
   - Primary image selection
   - Image deletion

2. **Editable Property Details:**
   - Inline editing of property details
   - Real-time validation
   - Server-side updates

3. **Financial Summary:**
   - Automatically calculated metrics
   - Editable income and expense figures
   - Visual representation of financial health

4. **Overview Sections:**
   - Tenant summary with lease information
   - Maintenance tasks overview
   - Upcoming cash flows display

## Setup Instructions

1. **Database Setup:**
   - Execute the SQL in `drizzle/property_management_tables.sql` in your Supabase project
   - Create the required tables and relationships
   - Setup storage bucket for property images

2. **Storage Bucket Setup:**
   - In Supabase dashboard, create a new storage bucket called `property-images`
   - Configure bucket policies to allow:
     - Public read access
     - Authenticated user uploads
     - Size limitations as needed

3. **Environment Variables:**
   - Ensure your Supabase URL and keys are properly configured in your environment
   - Other required environment variables should already be set up for the application

## Implementation Notes

1. **Image Handling:**
   - Images are stored in the `property-images` Supabase Storage bucket
   - Each image is stored in a folder named after the property ID
   - A corresponding record is created in the `property_images` table
   - Primary image is tracked with the `is_primary` flag

2. **Data Flow:**
   - All data is fetched server-side and passed to client components
   - Updates are performed via server actions that revalidate the page
   - Optimistic UI updates are used for better user experience

3. **Performance Considerations:**
   - Parallel data fetching to reduce page load time
   - Lazy loading of images in the carousel
   - Pagination for large datasets (tenants, maintenance items, etc.)

## Future Enhancements

1. **Financial & Tenants Tab:**
   - Implement detailed financial management features
   - More comprehensive tenant management

2. **Cash Flow Tab:**
   - Cash flow visualization and reporting
   - Cash flow forecasting

3. **Documents Tab:**
   - Document management for property-related files
   - Folder organization and search
