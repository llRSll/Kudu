# Property Detail Page Implementation

## Overview
The property detail page has been refactored to be server-side rendered with client components for interactive elements. This ensures good SEO performance while maintaining interactivity where needed.

## Component Structure

### Server Components
- `/app/(protected)/properties/[id]/page.tsx`
  - Main server component for the property detail page
  - Fetches all necessary data using server actions
  - Handles 404 errors with notFound()
  - Wraps client components in Suspense for better loading experience

- `/app/(protected)/properties/[id]/not-found.tsx`
  - Displayed when a property is not found
  - Provides a clean error state with a link back to properties list

### Client Components
- `/components/properties/property-detail-client.tsx`
  - Main client wrapper component
  - Manages tabs state and URL syncing
  - Renders all tab-specific components

- `/components/properties/property-page-skeleton.tsx`
  - Loading skeleton UI for the property page
  - Shown during initial data fetching and navigation

- `/components/properties/property-overview.tsx`
  - Overview tab component
  - Displays property images, key details, financial summary, tenant overview, and maintenance overview

- `/components/properties/property-financial-tenants.tsx`
  - Financial & Tenants tab component
  - Shows detailed tenant information, financial details, valuation history, and maintenance schedule
  - Shows development stages if property is in development

- `/components/properties/property-cashflow-tab.tsx`
  - Cash Flow tab component
  - Displays cash flow summary, detailed transaction list, and recurring transactions
  - Allows filtering and management of income/expense entries

- `/components/properties/property-documents-tab.tsx`
  - Documents tab component
  - Displays document list with filters, tagging, and management options
  - Integrates with document upload dialog

### Supporting Components
- `/components/properties/property-images.tsx`
  - Image carousel and image management for property
  
- `/components/properties/property-details.tsx`
  - Editable property details component
  
- `/components/properties/financial-summary.tsx`
  - Financial summary display and editing component
  
- `/components/properties/overview-summaries.tsx`
  - Tenant and maintenance summary components for overview tab
  
- `/components/properties/upcoming-cashflows.tsx`
  - Upcoming cash flows display for overview tab

## Server Actions
- `/app/actions/properties.ts`
  - CRUD operations for properties and related data
  - Fetch property by ID, financial summary, tenants, maintenance items, and property images

- `/app/actions/cashflows.ts`
  - CRUD operations for cash flows
  - Fetch upcoming cash flows and all cash flows for a property

## Data Flow
1. Server component fetches data using server actions
2. Data is passed to client components as props
3. Client components render UI and handle interactivity
4. Updates are sent back to the server via server actions

## Benefits of This Architecture
1. **Better SEO** - Critical content is server-rendered
2. **Faster Initial Load** - Main content loads quickly without waiting for client JS
3. **Progressive Enhancement** - Interactive features work as client JS loads
4. **Reduced Client-side JS** - Only interactive parts are hydrated
5. **Simplified Data Fetching** - Server actions handle data fetching and mutations
6. **Clear Separation of Concerns** - UI components are separated by functionality
